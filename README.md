#### Responsive Navbar

The navigation bar is fully reponsive, adjusting seamlessly to various screen sizes for smooth and accessible browsing on any device.

The navigation is always visible at the top of the website as it is fixed. The Bee Brain logo is on the left while the links to each quiz (General Knowledge, Geography, Movies) and the homepage are on the right. 

The presentation of the navigation changes in response to screen size. On larger screens, it take up the full width with all of the quiz names visible. On smaller screens, the navigation bar items condenses into a drop-down menu. 

In keeping the user interface themes of the website, when the quiz names is hovered over the text transforms to be x1.02 larger, the text color changes from red to black and a red box shadow highlights the word. The hover effect is disabled on current page to indicate to the userâ€™s current location.

***I found the wireframing process straightforward and user-friendly. It's designed to be quick, which allowed me to focus on layout and user flow rather than visual details. The drag-and-drop interface made it easy to explore different ideas, and the sketch-style visuals helped keep the emphasis on functionality over design polish.***
