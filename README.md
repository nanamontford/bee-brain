### Introduction 

### User Stories 
- As a teacher, I want to quickly navigate between quizzes so I can use the site seamlessly while working with students.
- As a quiz enthusiast, I want confirmation of my score so I can reflect on my answers and improve.
- As a first-time user, I want an inviting welcome page so I can quickly understand the site and decide if it meets my needs.
- As a user, I want the website to be responsive so I can use it across different screen sizes.

There are further details on the user stories, as well as acceptance criteria, on the [project board](https://github.com/users/nanamontford/projects/4).

### Fonts 
Arial in bold was used for headers and Verdana for all other text. These fonts were chosen for readability, particularly for individuals with visual impairments. 

### Navigation Bar
![Navigation Bar](URL to be added "Navigation Bar")
The navigation bar is always visible at the top of the website as it is fixed. The Bee Brain logo is on the left, while the links to each quiz (General Knowledge, Geography, Movies) are on the right. 

The presentation of the navigation bar changes in response to screen size. On larger screens, it takes up the full width with all of the quiz names visible. On smaller screens, the navigation bar items condense into a drop-down menu. 

In keeping with the user interface themes of the website, when a quiz name is hovered over, the text transforms to be x1.02 larger, the text color changes from red to black and a red box shadow highlights the word. The hover effect is disabled on the current page to indicate the userâ€™s location.
