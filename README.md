***I found the wireframing process straightforward and user-friendly. It's designed to be quick, which allowed me to focus on layout and user flow rather than visual details. The drag-and-drop interface made it easy to explore different ideas, and the sketch-style visuals helped keep the emphasis on functionality over design polish.***
